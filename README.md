# About Prometeus.LanguageSpec

Prometeus.LanguageSpec goal is to create GtkSourceView language specification for the [Prometeus](http://www.prometeus.ru/) distant learning system to allow editing test files in GEdit or other editor based on GtkSourceView with syntax highlighting.

# Install (Windows)

1. Install [GEdit for Windows](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gedit/2.30/gedit-setup-2.30.1-1.exe). You can always get latest version here: http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/

2. Copy prometeus.lang file in C:\Program Files\gedit\share\gtksourceview-2.0\language-specs. Note that in 64-bit Windows gedit would install to C:\Program Files (x86)\gedit.

# Install (Linux)

1. Install GEdit using your package manager. In Debian it should be: `sudo apt-get install gedit` 

2. Copy prometeus.lang file in /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs and /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs. It would require superuser privileges: `sudo cp -f prometeus.lang /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs`

# Test if it works

Open file sample.test in GEdit - its content should be colored accoding to "Prometeus" test markup language.
 
# Usage tips

Language specification in designed to use with "Full" test markup shema but also works file if you are using "Simplified" markup shema. Not expect miracles - "Prometeus" test markup language is significantly informal and allow use HTML markup - is not always safe. Using syntax highlight makes formatting errors in the test much less frequent.

In the current specification version, HTML entity markup is realized, so entities like &amp;nbsp;, &amp;amp;, &amp;#160; are highlighted. HTML tags and attributes are not highlighted, and angle brackets "<" Ð¸ ">" highlighted as errors - this one to drive maximum author attention HTML markup in the test.

# Use with "Prometeus" test converter

Before use "Prometeus" test converter utility:

1. Change test file extension from .test to .txt. 
2. Make sure you are using Windows-style (CR+LF) line endings in file. 
3. For russian / cyrillic users: also make sure that file is in Windows-1251 encoding.

**Note:** For last two points you can use GEdit to save test file with desired line endings and encoding - just specify them in Save-As dialog.
